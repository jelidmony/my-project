			<b>History of fashion design </b> 
			<br>
			History of fashion design refers specifically to the development of the purpose
			 and intention behind garments,
			 shoes and accessories, and their design and construction.
			  The modern industry,
			  based around firms or fashion houses run by individual designers,
			   started in the 19th century with Charles Frederick Worth who,
			 beginning in 1858, was the first designer to have his label sewn into the garments he created.
			 Fashion started when humans began wearing clothes. These clothes were typically made from plants,
			  animal skins and bone. Before the mid-19th century the division between haute couture and ready-to-wear did not really exist.
			   But the most basic pieces of female clothing were made-to-measure
			    by dressmakers and seamstresses dealing directly with the client.
			    Most often, clothing was patterned, sewn and tailored in the household.
			  When storefronts appeared selling ready-to-wear clothing, this need was removed
			   from the domestic workload. <a href="#">Read more</a>

		<p>Women’s fashion has a long and colorful history and, in 
			the 20th century, newspapers captured it all! You can find
			 full newspaper pages with photographs of the latest fashions
			  from Paris, department store advertisements with drawings of
			   the popular frocks of the day, and articles covering social 
			   events and what fashionable people in attendance were wearing.
			    Here is a look at the history of fashion through newspapers, 
				starting with the time period 1900 to 1920. This is part 1 of a 3-part
				 series that will span fashion history from 1900 to 1960.

			<b>Men and fashion</b>
			<p>We’ve said it time and time again, menswear is ruled by history 
				and tradition. Every person in menswear (designer, stylist, 
				editor, etc) has taken inspiration from the past at one time or 
				another. And no era has been overlooked.

				Therefore, as we continue to explore the foundations of personal
			    style, I thought we’d take a quick look back at the last hundred
				-or-so years in men’s fashion. Perhaps this will provide a little
				insight or context as to how menswear shifts, and more importantly,
				how we can make informed decisions when it comes to buying clothing
				 and developing personal style.

			<b>Fashion in Africa</b>
			<p>African fashion has always been known for its daring use of color, from acid 
				oranges to luminous blues. When Michelle Obama wore a top by Nigerian
				 designer Maki Oh during her Africa tour in 2013, it was assumed the world's
				  eyes were finally on
				 the continent as a serious contender for fashion's emerging markets.
				Now, a new exhibition and book explore fashion and street style in four major
				African cities - Johannesburg, Casablanca, Lagos and Nairobi.
				"I wanted to capture a sense of the breadth and scope of the African fashion
				 Renaissance through the prism of these four cities," says the book's editor,
				 Hannah Azieb Pool.
				"Lagos, with its love of glamor, is turning into a real fashion powerhouse,
				Joburg has that edge that makes London look sleepy, Nairobi is super 
				creative and Casablanca's scene is small but distinctive."
				Fashion Cities Africa, which the book is named after, will be the first
				 major exhibition of contemporary African fashion to be showcased in the
				  U.K.
				Sub-saharan Africa's apparel and footwear market is reportedly worth $31
				 billion according to data by Euromonitor. Labels such as Nigeria's Maki Oh
				  - recently worn by Beyonce, Jewel By Lisa and Ikiré Jones are establishing
				  themselves as international brands beyond the continent.
